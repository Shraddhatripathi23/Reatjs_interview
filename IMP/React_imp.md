### Basic:

### 1. **What is React?**
   - React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.

### 2. **Why use React instead of other frameworks like Angular or Vue?**
   - React's virtual DOM optimizes rendering and improves performance.
   - It offers a component-based architecture which enhances reusability and maintainability.
   - Strong community support and extensive ecosystem.
   - It can be integrated with various backends easily.

### 3. **What is JSX?**
   - JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, recommended by React. It looks like HTML and enhances the readability of the React code.

### 4. **What is the virtual DOM?**
   - A virtual representation of the actual DOM elements. The rendering engine can quickly make changes to the virtual DOM and subsequently update the actual DOM in a more efficient and optimized manner.

### 5. **What are the differences between functional and class components?**
   - Class components have more features (like lifecycle methods) but are more verbose. Functional components are simpler and can use hooks to achieve similar functionalities.

### 6. **How do you create a component in React?**
   - Components can be created using class or functions. Here's a functional component example:
     ```javascript
     function Welcome(props) {
       return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
     }
     ```

### 7. **What are props in React?**
   - Props (short for "properties") are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only.

### 8. **How is state different from props?**
   - State is specific to a component and can be changed within the component. Props are passed from a parent component and are read-only for the receiving component.

### 9. **Explain the purpose of `render()` in React.**
   - It's a lifecycle method in class components responsible for returning the JSX to be rendered on the screen.

### 10. **What are React hooks?**
    - Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

### 11. **Explain the purpose of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.**
    - `useState` is used to add state management to functional components. `useEffect` is used to perform side effects (like data fetching, DOM manipulation) in functional components.

### 12. **What is a key in React and why is it important?**
    - A "key" is a special attribute added to elements in a list to make their renders efficient and to identify them uniquely.

### 13. **How do you handle events in React?**
    - Events are handled by adding event handlers in camelCase, like `onClick`, `onChange`.

### Intermediate:

### 14. **What is the context API?**
    - The Context API allows you to share values (data or functions) between components without passing props manually at every level.

### 15. **Explain the lifecycle methods of class components.**
    - Lifecycle methods are special methods that automatically get called as your component achieves certain milestones.

### 16. **How do you optimize performance in React applications?**
    - By using PureComponent, memoization, optimizing re-renders with shouldComponentUpdate, using React.memo for functional components, and profiling components with the React DevTools.

### 17. **What are higher-order components (HOC)?**
    - HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or functionalities.

### 18. **Explain controlled vs. uncontrolled components.**
    - Controlled components have their state controlled by React, using `setState`. Uncontrolled components store their state in the DOM.

### 19. **What is React Router and how do you use it?**
    - React Router is a library for handling routing in React apps. It allows you to navigate between pages and manage the browser history.

### 20. **How can you share information between components?**
    - Using props, context API, or state management libraries like Redux.

### 21. **What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?**
    - Prop drilling refers to the process of passing props down multiple levels of components. It can be avoided using Context API or state management libraries.

### 22. **Explain the concept of "lifting state up".**
    - It means moving the state to a common ancestor component so that it can be shared with other components.

### 23. **What are refs in React and how do you use them?**
    - Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

### 24. **What is the difference between `state` and `setState`?**
    - `state` is an object that holds data. `setState` is a method used to update this state.

### 25. **How do you handle forms in React?**
    - By using controlled components, where form data is handled by the React state.

### 26. **Explain the use of `useContext` hook.**
    - `useContext` allows you to use the context for a given context object.

### 27. **What is a Fragment in React?**
    - Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

### 28. **How do you handle errors in a React application?**
    - Using error boundaries and try-catch blocks in lifecycle methods.

### Advanced:

### 29. **What are render props?**
    - A technique where a component gets a prop that returns a React element.

### 30. **How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?**
    - It compares the current DOM with a new one (from new state/data) and updates the actual DOM for only the items that have changed.

### 31. **Explain the concept of Portals in React.**
    - Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node outside of the parent DOM hierarchy.

32. **What is suspense in React?**
    - Suspense lets your components “wait” for something before they can render, like data fetching.

### 33. **How do you implement code-splitting in React?**
    - Using `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>`.

### 34. **What are React hooks and name a few commonly used ones?**
    - Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

### 35. **How do you create custom hooks?**
    - By extracting component logic into reusable functions.

### 36. **Explain the `useReducer` hook and its use cases.**
    - `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState`. It helps in managing state logic in more complex scenarios.

### 37. **How do you integrate third-party libraries with React?**
    - By installing them via npm/yarn and importing them into your components.

### 38. **How do you handle side effects in React applications?**
    - Using the `useEffect` hook or lifecycle methods.

### 39. **What is forward ref?**
    - It allows passing ref from a parent to a child component.

### 40. **How does React's concurrent mode work?**
    - It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle user input or keep an animation smooth.

### General:

### 41. **How do you test React components

?**
    - Using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

### 42. **What are popular libraries/tools you'd use alongside React?**
    - Redux, React Router, Axios, Styled-components, etc.

### 43. **How do you handle SEO in React applications?**
    - Using server-side rendering and libraries like React Helmet.

### 44. **What is server-side rendering (SSR) and how is it beneficial in React?**
    - SSR renders React components on the server rather than the client. It's beneficial for SEO and initial page load performance.

### 45. **How do you handle state management in large React applications?**
    - Using libraries like Redux, MobX, or the Context API.

### 46. **What is the difference between `create-react-app`, Next.js, and Gatsby?**
    - `create-react-app` is a tool to set up a new React project without build configuration. Next.js offers server-side rendering and routing. Gatsby is a static site generator using React.

### 47. **Explain the concept of virtualized lists in React.**
    - Virtualized lists render only the visible items in a list, improving performance for long lists.

### 48. **How do you ensure accessibility in your React applications?**
    - Using semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and libraries like `react-a11y`.

### 49. **How do you handle internationalization (i18n) in React?**
    - Using libraries like `react-intl` or `i18next`.

### 50. **Describe a challenging problem you've faced with React and how you solved it.**
    - This is subjective and would depend on the interviewee's personal experience.
