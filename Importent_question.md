Basic:
## What is React?
'''
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
'''

Why use React instead of other frameworks like Angular or Vue?

React's virtual DOM optimizes rendering and improves performance.
It offers a component-based architecture which enhances reusability and maintainability.
Strong community support and extensive ecosystem.
It can be integrated with various backends easily.
What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, recommended by React. It looks like HTML and enhances the readability of the React code.
What is the virtual DOM?

A virtual representation of the actual DOM elements. The rendering engine can quickly make changes to the virtual DOM and subsequently update the actual DOM in a more efficient and optimized manner.
What are the differences between functional and class components?

Class components have more features (like lifecycle methods) but are more verbose. Functional components are simpler and can use hooks to achieve similar functionalities.
How do you create a component in React?

Components can be created using class or functions. Here's a functional component example:
javascript
Copy code
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
What are props in React?

Props (short for "properties") are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only.
How is state different from props?

State is specific to a component and can be changed within the component. Props are passed from a parent component and are read-only for the receiving component.
Explain the purpose of render() in React.

It's a lifecycle method in class components responsible for returning the JSX to be rendered on the screen.
What are React hooks?

Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
Explain the purpose of useState and useEffect hooks.

useState is used to add state management to functional components. useEffect is used to perform side effects (like data fetching, DOM manipulation) in functional components.
What is a key in React and why is it important?

A "key" is a special attribute added to elements in a list to make their renders efficient and to identify them uniquely.
How do you handle events in React?

Events are handled by adding event handlers in camelCase, like onClick, onChange.
Intermediate:
What is the context API?

The Context API allows you to share values (data or functions) between components without passing props manually at every level.
Explain the lifecycle methods of class components.

Lifecycle methods are special methods that automatically get called as your component achieves certain milestones.
How do you optimize performance in React applications?

By using PureComponent, memoization, optimizing re-renders with shouldComponentUpdate, using React.memo for functional components, and profiling components with the React DevTools.
What are higher-order components (HOC)?

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or functionalities.
Explain controlled vs. uncontrolled components.

Controlled components have their state controlled by React, using setState. Uncontrolled components store their state in the DOM.
What is React Router and how do you use it?

React Router is a library for handling routing in React apps. It allows you to navigate between pages and manage the browser history.
How can you share information between components?

Using props, context API, or state management libraries like Redux.
What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?

Prop drilling refers to the process of passing props down multiple levels of components. It can be avoided using Context API or state management libraries.
Explain the concept of "lifting state up".

It means moving the state to a common ancestor component so that it can be shared with other components.
What are refs in React and how do you use them?

Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.
What is the difference between state and setState?

state is an object that holds data. setState is a method used to update this state.
How do you handle forms in React?

By using controlled components, where form data is handled by the React state.
Explain the use of useContext hook.

useContext allows you to use the context for a given context object.
What is a Fragment in React?

Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
How do you handle errors in a React application?

Using error boundaries and try-catch blocks in lifecycle methods.
Advanced:
What are render props?

A technique where a component gets a prop that returns a React element.
How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?

It compares the current DOM with a new one (from new state/data) and updates the actual DOM for only the items that have changed.
Explain the concept of Portals in React.

Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node outside of the parent DOM hierarchy.
What is suspense in React?

Suspense lets your components “wait” for something before they can render, like data fetching.
How do you implement code-splitting in React?

Using React.lazy() and <Suspense>.
What are React hooks and name a few commonly used ones?

Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext.
How do you create custom hooks?

By extracting component logic into reusable functions.
Explain the useReducer hook and its use cases.

useReducer is an alternative to useState. It helps in managing state logic in more complex scenarios.
How do you integrate third-party libraries with React?

By installing them via npm/yarn and importing them into your components.
How do you handle side effects in React applications?

Using the useEffect hook or lifecycle methods.
What is forward ref?

It allows passing ref from a parent to a child component.
How does React's concurrent mode work?

It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle user input or keep an animation smooth.
General:
How do you test React components?

Using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
What are popular libraries/tools you'd use alongside React?

Redux, React Router, Axios, Styled-components, etc.
How do you handle SEO in React applications?

Using server-side rendering and libraries like React Helmet.
What is server-side rendering (SSR) and how is it beneficial in React?

SSR renders React components on the server rather than the client. It's beneficial for SEO and initial page load performance.
How do you handle state management in large React applications?

Using libraries like Redux, MobX, or the Context API.
What is the difference between create-react-app, Next.js, and Gatsby?

create-react-app is a tool to set up a new React project without build configuration. Next.js offers server-side rendering and routing. Gatsby is a static site generator using React.
Explain the concept of virtualized lists in React.

Virtualized lists render only the visible items in a list, improving performance for long lists.
How do you ensure accessibility in your React applications?

Using semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and libraries like react-a11y.
How do you handle internationalization (i18n) in React?

Using libraries like react-intl or i18next.
Describe a challenging problem you've faced with React and how you solved it.

This is subjective and would depend on the interviewee's personal experience.
I hope this provides a good starting point for preparing for React interviews!
